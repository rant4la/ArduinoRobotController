# ArduinoRobotDrawer

This Arduino app controls a 2-axis robot that can draw shapes. If a led is attached to the end of the robot arm, it can be captured with long exposure time to produce images, like this:

## Tutorial:

1. Edit the animateObject() function in main.ino to change which image the robot draws.
2. Upload the app
3. Type 'c' in the Serial Monitor to start/stop animation
4. Take a long exposure picture with lighttrail setting turned on. I use iOS app: Slow Camera.
